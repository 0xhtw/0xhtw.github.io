### In this writeup, I'll be sharing my knowledge on the modern day ransomware movement and the pioneers behind it. Grab a шашлык (basically a russian kebab from my knowledge, *pronounced Shashlyk*), sit back and enjoy the writeup.

### Selecta!!! Old school UK Garage, 2001, the golden year which I wasn't even alive for. Badman track. 



# Chapter I - Background

For around a decade now, hacking has become more and more financially motivated each year. With 2017 being the catalyst and motivator for many groups I would say, following the WannaCry outbreak in May 2017.


No one really hacks for fun, knowledge or to sharpen their skills anymore, we don't have any more Gary McKinnons' (absolute mad lad btw). 


So, with ransomware being such a lucrative business model now, (yes, threat actors actually classify themselves as business operators, not criminals lol, i have seen this first hand)


You might be asking, who is the MVP, the key player in the industry? No one in particular, but a certain region dominates the industry, which is by far Russia. 


However, I do side with the Russians, their name often tarnished for "hating the west" and constantly getting the blame for random cyberattacks that happen in and around the world day to day. Whilst yeah, to a degree some of it is true, the stereotype is quite narrowminded. A lot of big cyberatttacks especially in 2025, have been committed by english speaking geeks in their UK and USA bedrooms. 


This doesn't change their heavy presence in cybercrime today, as like I said they are one of the key players in Ransomware which I'll now get into.
