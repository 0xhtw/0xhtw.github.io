    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m htwTana. At least that is what I go by when publishing my works online.
      I love computers, cars, music, art and most importantly anything cybersecurity. 
      I started from a young age and I am dedicated to persistent self development 
      and improvement, sharing my findings in things such as malware analysis,
      reverse engineering and threat intelligence.
      
      I dropped out of school from a young age to pursue a career within IT, but 
      I always knew that I was destined for the infosec field as growing up I had a 
      natural talent for learning anything hacking and malware related, it didn't take
      long before I got into trouble at school for shutting all the computers off on the 
      domain. I won't go into that too much but that's how I knew I wanted to put all my
      efforts into cybersecurity. I have a deep passion for it, it's not a career path I 
      desire just to make money, it is something I enjoy doing and continue to improve on
      in my own personal time. You'll see that in the section below talking on what htw is.

  <h2>What is htw?</h2>
  <p>
    HTW stands for <strong>Hack The World</strong> — it started in Milton Keynes as an
    artistic collective and grew into a small group of people in paint stained North Faces who 
    love computers, hacking, creating  and many other things. Beyond painting walls, we spend 
    time in our workshop taking apart hardware, reverse engineering, and building cool things together.  
  </p>
    Picture a handful of kids in paint-stained North Face jackets, surrounded by circuit boards, tools, 
    and screens. That’s HTW — a collective that grew from graffiti to tech exploration. We take apart hardware, 
    reverse engineer software, and push ourselves to build new things — always curious, always learning.
  <p>
    HTW can be found across Milton Keynes and even in the surrounding areas —
    Northampton, Bedford, Luton, London, and Birmingham. It represents both the street
    presence and the creative, technical side of what we do. 
    HTW embodies a mindset: explore, experiment, and push boundaries. 
    Our focus is on building skills, innovating, and having fun while doing it.
    A philosophy relates to and drives my work in cybersecurity.
