    <p>
      Hi, I’m 0xhtw. At least that is what I go by when publishing my works online.
      I love computers, cars, music, art and most importantly anything cybersecurity. 
      I started from a young age and I am dedicated to persistent self development 
      and improvement, sharing my findings in things such as malware analysis,
      reverse engineering and threat intelligence.
      
      I dropped out of school from a young age to pursue a career within IT, but 
      I always knew that I was destined for the infosec field as growing up I had a 
      natural talent for learning anything hacking and malware related, it didn't take
      long before I got into trouble at school for shutting all the computers off on the 
      domain. I won't go into that too much but that's how I knew I wanted to put all my
      efforts into cybersecurity. I have a deep passion for it, it's not a career path I 
      desire just to make money, it is something I enjoy doing and continue to improve on
      in my own personal time. You'll see that in the section below talking on what htw is.

  <h2>what is htw?</h2>
  <p>
    HTW stands for <strong>Hack The World</strong> — began in Milton Keynes, a city with a reputation for pioneering tech
    and bold urban design, what started as a small artistic collective evolved into a small group of people passionate about
    creativity, technology and exploration in both urban and digital senses.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTW exists across different spaces, both online and offline. Representing our crossover between urban street art culture and technology.
    It's more than a crew, it's a mindset of exploration, experimentation, and pushing boundaries. 
  </p>
  <p>
    That philosophy guides my work in cybersecurity: the drive to learn, to innovate and share knowledge in ways that make systems stronger
    and uncover new findings in the forever evolving world of cybersecurity.
